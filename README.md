# GhostrunnerRNG
Randomizes enemies in a challenging and unexpected way, every time you load a level.<br>
It is challenging and it will test how fast you can adapt and figure out how to clear the kill rooms.<br>
Also... It is 100% harder then the classic difficulty.

## Open Beta Version
After months of hard work, we're excited to announce the open beta for this project!

- Enemies(all types)
- Shield Orbs
- Checkpoints

### How to use?
Simple! start the GhostrunnerRNG.exe with Ghostrunner, and start any level.<br>**YOU MUST RESTART CHECKPOINT after entering a level** to make rng work!<br>

## About
### Credits
Designed and coded by DmgVol and LongerWarrior. 

Huge thanks to the GR community for alpha testing and supporting the mod from early stages of development!<br>
Special Thanks: JanisSG.

### Bugs?! Report it!
Since this is an early stage of the mod and does not reflect the final version, you may and will experience bugs.

Please do not hesitate to report any bugs/issues/suggestions in GRSR Discord!

### Who it is aimed at?
Basically, anyone who's looking for a new GR challenge, could be someone who speedruns the game, thinks the game is too predictable/easy, or just wants a new challenge.

## Disclaimer
The mod works similar to a game trainer, it reads and modifies game memory, so your antivirus _might_ alert you - that's normal and expected.<br>
The main memory reading/writing happens when the level is fully loaded(in the first few seconds), so if the game crashes mid-run.. that's not the mod!
